frontend -> refer to backend api '/auth/42'

'/auth/42' is guarded by passport, will send the user to the authentication page, and redirect to callbackURL with a temporary code attached
the callbackURL is guarded by the same strategy, but will now get an accessToken in exchange for the code, once that's done, the following happens:

- the 'validate' function from the strategy is called, allowing us to fetch the user's information from the database.
  Once this function finishes, the returned Object is attached to the Request as 'user' (request.user)

When using 'session' and 'initialize':
- the 'serializeUser' function is called, allowing us to save some data in the 'sess' column of the session stored in the 'session' table of the database
  Once this function finishes, the returned Object is attached to the Request as 'session.passport' (request.session.passport)

Then finally our route is accessed, in which we have access to the cookie and the user object
