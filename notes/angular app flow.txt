index.html contains this line:

<body>
  <app-root></app-root>
</body>

@Component decorator defines the following:
	'selector' - the tag used to refer to this component
	'template' - the html code containing references to the css and component variables,functions
	'style' - the css code containing the markdown of the html attributes

'app-root' is defined as the 'selector' of the @Component decorator of the AppComponent class

@NgModule decorator defines the following:
	'declarations' - children of the module, components that live in the scope and can import from the listed imports
	'imports' - other modules that can be imported by components of this module
	'providers' - classes that can be listed as constructor parameters of a component, these classes are then provided to the components automatically
	'bootstrap' - when the module is bootstrapped, these components are also bootstrapped.
	'exports' - mark components as export, so they become available when the module is imported into another module.

the AppComponent is listed as a member (declaration) of the AppModule, and also added as part of the bootstrap.

then finally in main.ts we bootstrap AppModule:
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).catch(err => console.error(err));

bootstrap is een vage term; 'Bootstrapping is a technique of initializing or loading our Angular application'
