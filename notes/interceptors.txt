Interceptors are methods that are applied before a Request is send to the back-end, and after receiving the response from the server\
(basically a pipe with extra functionality)

We can create an Interceptor that adds the Authentication token to the request (if it exists) before sending it to the backend API

We then bundle all our interceptors (this is to keep it modular in case we add more interceptors) in a InterceptorProvider

export const InterceptorProvider = [
	{ provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: NameInterceptor, multi: true },
	{ ... }
]
