Observable - an object that takes a 'subscribe' function as its constructor
observable.subscribe(observer) creates a Subscription, which contains the execution of the subscribe function on the observer

the observer should contain:
next(x) - mandatory
error(x)
complete(x)

the 'subscribe' function should generate next(), error(), complete() events
